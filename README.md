This weather-app demonstrates use of API's to create a full functioning weather application with real time data. This will give you weather data for up to three days, anywhere in the world. The background changes depending on if it is night or day in the area, and you can see hourly or daily average data. Humidity, chance of rain, sunrise/sunset, and more are also included in the current data.
